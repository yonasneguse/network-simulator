# network simulator
 
This program works as a neighbor network simulator, where the first host sends pings to its neighbors. This program continues to run until the timer's duration is up, in which the hosts will send and receive pings between each other

The code takes an input file of various numbers that have certain values (i.e the first number in the file is the address of the first host). There is an input file included in the repo, to which you can change the values and see how it changes the output.

No downloads are needed to run this code, just an IDE.
